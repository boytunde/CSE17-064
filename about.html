					Bangkok became the capital of Siam (as Thailand was previously known) in 1782, when General Chao Phraya Chakkri, the founder of the ruling Chakkri dynasty, assumed the throne as Rama I and moved the court from the west to the east bank of the Chao Phraya River.
				</p>
				<p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
					Rama IV (1851–68) developed the city while continuing, at a reduced rate, the traditional building of wats. The Grand Palace was improved, a number of substantial dwellings were constructed for members of the royal family, several new streets were laid down, and a reduction was made in the large number of floating houses anchored along the riverfront. A new route, Charoen Krung (New Road), leading southward, was constructed, and a new city moat, Khlong Phadung Krung Kasem, parallel to the city’s first canal, was dug and fortified; a long canal led from it to the present port area (Khlong Toei), thus allowing small boats to bypass the large bend in the river immediately south of the city.

					Bangkok is a huge city of more than 1 million inhabitants, and even though it is characterised with high-rise buildings, congestion and exotic nightlife, it really has so much more to offer. For those who wish to discover the heart of the city, they will find magnificent palaces, spiritual temples, busy markets, and a thriving nightlife to rival any capital city

					Due to Bangkok’s location of just 14 degrees above the equator, temperatures are always going to be over 30C, but don’t let that stop you going out and discovering the attractions of Bangkok. One of the best ways to see the city is by bike, and by avoiding the main roads and seeking out smaller streets and alleys, it is possible to find picturesque parks, busy markets and spiritual temples. It is also possible to find excursions to the Bangkok Jungle to meet locals and experience the tranquillity of Bangkok’s paddy fields and orchid farms. 
				</p>
				<p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
					To experience some of Bangkok’s traditional culture and history, there are many spectacular performances that can be found throughout the city, and one of the best districts being Ratchadaphisek. The whole area comes to life with entertainment from clubs, theatres and bars but for those looking for a more traditional Thai performance, the Siam Niramit mixes modern technology with traditional dance and the Thailand’s Cultural Centre offers authentic and traditional shows.

				<p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
					Seafood dishes are a speciality in Bangkok and there are restaurants that cater for all price ranges and the Huai Khwang district is a good place to start, especially for late night dining. If you want to go where the locals go, visit the Bali Seafood in the Ratchadaphisek district, where you’ll find up to 4,000 Thais all eating and drinking with huge TV screens and live music for entertainment. Royal City Avenue (RCA) is also a great street to go for nightlife offering huge trendy clubs made popular with special effects, stunning interiors and live bands. These are very much where the locals go and a great place to experience real Bangkok entertainment.
